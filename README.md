# Read Me

This project was setup from a template designed for using [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) on linux in [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

(Unless you are viewing the template itself in which case see info at [about-template.md](/about-template.md) on installing and using it.)

## Setup

0. Install clang-format (if not installed already)
1. Open in vscode
2. Click button `Open Workspace`
3. Run command `Extensions: Configure Recommended Extensions (Workspace Folder)` (you can bring up command pallet by using `ctrl + shift + p` and type it in)
4. Start using!

## Tasks

- build (builds project using make)
- run (runs compiled project)
- kill (will kill program if it's running)

`ctrl + shift + b` will run kill, build, and run (this happens by default on save)
